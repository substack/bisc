arbitrary bit vectors for better huffman coding
this would be such a feat to actually build
infinite addressable memory space BY DESIGN THAT'S RIGHT

instructions
    swap two instructions

meta registers
    register size register
        sets the register size 
        modern compilers need lots of register space
    register size register's register size register
        sets the size of the register size register,
        depends on the register size register
    general registers register
        number of general registers to register
